## Usage
tbd

## Motivation
According to [Golden Rule](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices?tab=readme-ov-file#section-0%EF%B8%8Fâƒ£-the-golden-rule) of testing, I try to keep my Playwright tests flat and simple, to read them like a poem. Calls of `test.step()` add extra visual complexity and nesting. Moving step titles to comments makes test code clear and readable.
